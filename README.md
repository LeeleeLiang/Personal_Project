# Projects
###### *Containing some interesting projects that I've done over the years of college. Both on my own and for school.*

**Computer Vision - Linear Least Squares**
- Fit given line to two dimensional data points using the following linear least square techniques:
  1. Line fitting using Linear Least Squares
  2. Reduce overfitting using Regularization (ridge regression)

**Computer Vision - Eigenfaces for face recognition**
- Match given test image to every image in a gallery and find a match that is the most similar to the test image. Techniques used:
  1. Implemented principal components analysis technique to represent faces in a lower dimensional space and to recognize them.
